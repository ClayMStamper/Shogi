The Smooth UI System is a very simple system which uses Unity's Animation Curves.
You can find all the source code for the system in the 'Scripts' folder.
The code is not commented and we don't plan to provide any updates to the system.
The 'Test Scenes' folder contains 3 scenes. Two contain some early tests we did of the system. Note: The Login test scene has NOT been setup with Database Control Pro.
The features video we made for Database Control Pro is also included. (The soundtrack is not included for copyright reasons)

Our main focus is on Database Control Pro and not the UI System included, however we are still willing to answer any questions you might have about the system.
